\section{Docker}

\paragraph{\hspace{24pt}}
A docker is an open source enterprise, which can be used to launch any type of application/module as a light- weight container.

\paragraph{\hspace{24pt}}
Due to dockers, there is independence between applications, infrastructure, developers and IT ops. This unlocks their potentials and a model is created for better collaboration and innovation.

\paragraph{\hspace{24pt}}
A docker is simple, agile, secure, portable and also reduces cost.

\section{Relation between Cloud Computing and Docker}

\textbf{1. Docker with PaaS:} {Dockers are used as fundamental units by various service providers. These include AWS Elastic Beanstalk, OpenShift or Dokku. PaaS provides automation as well as the coding environment. This should be flexible and available on demand. There shouldnâ€™t be any downtime or delay. There has been a shift from virtual machines to docker containers in many IaaS layers.}\\

\textbf{2. Docker with IaaS:} {Besides coding environment, there is a provision for computing platforms or a virtual server which is completely isolated from the host. It is very easy to setup a docker cluster which may have an installed webserver.}\\
