\chapter{Various Methods of Data Security on Cloud}
\paragraph{\hspace{24pt}}
There are various algorithms and measures we can use to secure data on the virtualized environment of the cloud. They are Cryptography, Homomorphic Encryption, Diffie Hellman Algorithm, Rivest-Shamir-Adleman Algorithm(RSA), Container Clustering using Dockers.

\paragraph{\hspace{24pt}}
Cryptography can be used to encrypt the data stored on the cloud. But encrypting a large amount of data can be very challenging and time consuming.

\paragraph{\hspace{24pt}}
Other Encryption techniques such as Homomorphic Encryption and various algorithms such as RSA and DH algorithms can also be used to do the same. The major issue in using them is the excessive use of resources which eventually lead to an increased cost and time.

\paragraph{\hspace{24pt}}
Out of the five methods, Container Clustering using Dockers is one of the better and more efficient options to use for securing data on the cloud.

\paragraph{\hspace{24pt}}
Using dockers has its own advantage and because of this it beats all the other methods of securing data.
