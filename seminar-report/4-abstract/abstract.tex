In the current world with immense technological advancement, the Information Technology(IT) world is switching from physical storage to cloud storage since the “cloud” providers supply resources on demand over the Internet. Cloud computing is a successful and speedy evolving model with new features and capabilities being announced regularly. The concept of this is known as “pay as you use” which enables the firms to shift to cloud. Due to this, security of such data has become an issue. Security of cloud-based applications is one of the key concerns of cloud customers. These three principles of cloud security are Availability, Confidentiality and Integrity. One of the most efficient ways is with the help of Container Clustering. There are various ways in which container clustering can be achieved. This paper presents the study and the comparison between two such technologies, i.e. Docker Swarm and Kubernetes.
