\chapter{Using Kubernetes Instead of Docker Swarm}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The efficiency of the afore mentioned model can be increased by the utilization of Kubernetes rather than Docker Swarm.
    \item When we compare the two container clustering tools, namely Kubernetes and Docker, Kubernetes excel in both power as well as performance. It also enables greater flexibility in container management.
    \item Like Docker, Kubernetes is also an open- source system that provides similar functions such as automating deployment, scaling, and the management of containerized applications.
    \item Therefore, we can use Kubernetes for optimizing the existing design to make it more efficient. It also provides fault tolerance.
