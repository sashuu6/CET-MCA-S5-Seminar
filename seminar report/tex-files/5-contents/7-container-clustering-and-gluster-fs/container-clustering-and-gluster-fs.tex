\section{Container Clustering}

\paragraph{\hspace{24pt}}
The job of the container is to turn a number of docker engines into one, single body or entity. This means that the management and launch of containers in multiple systems works as a single body. Container Clustering can be achieved by utilizing the Swarm Manager.
