\chapter{What is a Container?}

\paragraph{\hspace{24pt}}
“A container image is a lightweight, stand-alone, executable package of a piece of software that includes everything needed to run it: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries, settings.”

\paragraph{\hspace{24pt}}
It is available for both Windows and Linux based applications. We can call it platform-independent since the “containerized software will always run the same, whatever be the environment.”

\paragraph{\hspace{24pt}}
The containers isolate the software from its environment, This helps in minimizing the conflicts between groups running different software or application on the same infrastructure.
